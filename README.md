Booking Simulator


✨ Description

This project is a service-oriented .NET console application designed to simulate and automate employee check-in and check-out bookings.
It integrates with various OBS APIs to synchronize personnel data, work schedules, and booking records.


🔍 Features

🔹 Automated Employee Bookings
Employees are automatically booked based on their work shifts.

🔹 OBS API Integration
The application fetches personnel and work schedule data from OBS services.

Settings are stored in a separate appsettings.OBS.Configuration.json file for better maintainability.
